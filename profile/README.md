Achieving "automotive-level" intelligence can be accomplished through the integration of Large Language Models (LLM) with external knowledge sources, either via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning, along with the use of various tools. Reaching "closed-loop" level automation requires the deployment of multiple domain-specific agents. Ultimately, achieving full automation necessitates the collaboration of these agents.

In a real-world product, additional considerations such as trustworthiness, security, and the orchestration of hybrid models are crucial.

We are developing a production-ready platform tailored for the fintech vertical, with plans to scale across additional verticals.
